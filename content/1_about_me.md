# About Me

Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/">Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> at the University of Chicago. I study galaxy clusters with a variety of X-ray instruments. My current project uses Chandra data to investigate the nature of gas perturbations produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to infer the dominant energy-transfer mechanism from AGN to the intracluster medium (ICM). I am applying a technique that allows the decomposition of gas perturbations based on the processes that drive them (e.g., weak shocks, gas motions, bubbles, cooling).

I received my undergraduate degree in physics at Washington University in St. Louis, where my senior thesis focused on analysis of the accretion-powered high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2, a highly variable source whose behavior can provide insight into some of the more mysterious aspects of accretion physics. I then spent two years in Germany earning my masters degree in astrophysics at Universitaet Bonn. There, I analyzed eROSITA data of the Virgo Cluster, focusing specifically on non-equilibrium effects at its outskirts.
