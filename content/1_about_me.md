# About Me

Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/">Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> at the University of Chicago. I study galaxy clusters with a variety of X-ray instruments. My current project uses Chandra data to investigate the nature of gas perturbations produced by active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback to infer the dominant energy-transfer mechanism from AGN to the intracluster medium (ICM).

I received my undergraduate degree in physics at Washington University in St. Louis, where my senior thesis focused on analysis of NICER data of the accretion-powered high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2. I then spent two years in Germany earning my masters degree in astrophysics at the <a href="https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en">Argelander-Institut für Astronomie</a> at Universität Bonn. There, I analyzed eROSITA data of the Virgo Cluster, focusing specifically on non-equilibrium effects at its outskirts.
