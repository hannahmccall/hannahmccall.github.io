# About Me

Hello! I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/">Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> at the University of Chicago. I study active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxy clusters with a variety of X-ray instruments. In my upcoming paper, I use an image manipulation technique applied to archival Chandra data to identify the physical mechanisms behind morphologically identified features in areas surrounding AGN feedback. My current project involves applying a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...940..122R/abstract">new time-dependent photoionization model</a> to XMM and Nustar data of Mrk 766. I am also a member of the XRISM Virgo Cluster target team.

I received my undergraduate degree in physics at Washington University in St. Louis, where my senior thesis focused on analysis of NICER data of the accretion-powered high-mass X-ray binary GX 301-2. I then spent two years in Germany earning my masters degree in astrophysics at the <a href="https://astro.uni-bonn.de/en">Argelander-Institut für Astronomie</a> at Universität Bonn. There, I analyzed <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/09/aa49391-24/aa49391-24.html">eROSITA data of the Virgo Cluster</a>, focusing specifically on its outskirts.
