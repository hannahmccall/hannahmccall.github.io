<h3>Current work: Identifying perturbations around AGN feedback</h3>

<p><img src="m87_example.jpeg"  width="100%" height="350px"></p>

<p>There is evidence to suggest that active galactic nuclei (AGN) are the heat source responsible for counterbalancing cooling at the center of massive galaxy clusters and groups. However, the method of energy transfer from AGN to the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM) is still not well understood. Using a technique coined "X-arithmetic", which is introduced in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/463/1/1057/2589979">this work</a>, my current project aims to dissect and characterize the mayhem around regions of AGN feedback in a sample of ~15 objects so that we can better understand the dominant energy transfer mechanisms. </p>

<p>The figure above is an example from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/463/1/1057/2589979">Churazov et al. 2016</a>, where X-arithmetic was applied to the center of the Virgo Cluster, M87. Each image excludes one type of perturbation, allowing us to better distinguish between the radio bubbles, shock waves, and isobaric perturbations (subsonic gas motions, cooling gas, and gravity waves), all of which are tentatively identified and labeled above. </p>

<h3>Recent publication: View of the Virgo Cluster with SRG/eROSITA</h3>

<p><img src="eROslide.png"  width="80%" height="400px"></p>

<p>eROSITA was launched in 2019 with a main science goal of detecting the hot intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters. Our closest cluster neighbor, Virgo, is a perfect target for a detailed study of the ICM, and was observed by eROSITA during its four complete all-sky surveys. With its observations, we were able to identify the full extent of two large cold fronts in Virgo, measure the gas clumping, and report on extended emission beyond M49.
